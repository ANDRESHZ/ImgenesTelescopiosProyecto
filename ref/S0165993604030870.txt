Abstract: Cerebral cortex refers to the near-surface regions of the brain. While these regions are known to support the complex brain functions of man, the functions are still not well understood. However, non-invasive techniques for forming images of changing regional blood flow (rCBF) or blood volume (rCBV) in the cerebral cortex have recently become available. One of the techniques, called optical topography, shows promise not only for medical treatment but also for learning- and education-related studies. The principle is to irradiate the head with near-infrared light and analyze reflection and scattering at the brain's surface.
